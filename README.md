# 🛍️ Superstore Sales Analysis Dashboard

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of the **Superstore Sales Dataset**, focusing on sales performance, regional trends, and category-wise insights. The goal is to extract meaningful business intelligence to support strategic decision-making using Power BI.

## 📊 Project Overview

The dataset contains sales transactions from a fictional superstore, including information on:

- Order ID, Product, and Category
- Sales, Quantity, Profit, and Discounts
- Customer and Region details
- Shipping information and dates

Using Power BI, we created an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze:

- 📈 Sales and profit trends over time  
- 🌍 Regional and state-wise performance  
- 🛒 Top-performing and underperforming categories and products  
- 🎯 Customer segmentation based on purchase behavior  
- 🚚 Shipping performance and delivery status
